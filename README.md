# Hilt-Method-Injection-Demo
This repository demonstrates the concept of **Hilt Method Injection in Android**, as explained in the Medium article:

**[Hilt Method Injection in Android: Why and When to Use It](https://medium.com/@emon.dev.bd/hilt-method-injection-in-android-why-and-when-to-use-it-4014a9f6a614)**  

The article explains the advantages of method injection over field injection, along with real-life examples and step-by-step implementation.

## Overview

Hilt Method Injection is useful in scenarios where:

- Field injection falls short, especially when dependencies require initialization logic that cannot be directly applied to fields.
- Dependencies need to be provided dynamically based on runtime parameters.
- Better lifecycle control for certain dependencies is required.

This demo showcases a simple yet practical implementation of method injection using Hilt, covering the following:

- **Dependency Management with Hilt**
- **Comparisons between Field and Method Injection**
- **When to Choose Method Injection**
